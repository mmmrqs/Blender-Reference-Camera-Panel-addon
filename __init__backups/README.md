### These 2 zip files contain versions for the "__\_\_init\_\_.py__" that can be unzipped and copied to the main folder before installing the addon.

- [x] reference_cameras.zip - contains the default "__\_\_init\_\_.py__" file used by the Reference Camera Panel addon for Blender

- [x] bl_ui_widgets_demo.zip - contains an alternative "__\_\_init\_\_.py__" file to showcase a demo panel displaying all the available widget components.  It may be usefull for people that intends to use the BL_UI_Widgets API for building their own addons. 


Note: in order to use one or the other, the user just need to unzip the desired file in the main folder of the addon and re-install the addon in Blender. In the case of the widgets demo there will be a separate tab in Blender's N'Panel of the 3D Viewport window, with a label as "BL_UI_Widget".
